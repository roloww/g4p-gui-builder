/*
The data folder:
If your tool is using files like images, sound files, any data file, etc., 
put them into the data folder.  When writing your tool you can use the 
following methods as a starting point to load or get files from the data folder,
these are suggestions amongst many other solutions.

When using an Object which extends PApplet inside your tool, PApplet's internal 
methods such as loadImage, loadStrings, etc. will use your tool's data folder to find 
files to be loaded.
