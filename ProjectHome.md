## Folders and Files created by this tool ##
When saving the sketch tab (user supplier name) the tool will create the following files and folders

**gui.pde (file)**

a secondary tab that has all the code for declaring and creating the G4P controls. This tab is auto generated by the tool and should NOT be modified except to add code inside the event handlers.

**data  (folder)**

user images used for image buttons or other user supplied data required by the controls you have created are stored in this folder. The data folder is an integral part of the skecth and any other files that your sketch uses should be placed here.

**GUI\_BUILDER\_DATA   (folder)**

the tool uses this to store any information needed by the tool but not needed by the actual sketch. See below

**gui.ser.???   (file)**

this file is used to store the current GUI design from the tool and is saved in the GUI\_BUILDER\_FOLDER. It means that design data is persistant between editing sessions. The ??? is the tool version number.


Once the sketch is completed then the GUI\_BUILDER\_DATA folder and its contents can be deleted since it was only required during the GUI design phase using the GUI builder tool.
